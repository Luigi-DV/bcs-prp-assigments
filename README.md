# Procedural Programming Course (BCS)

This repository contains assignments of procedural programming concepts using Java.

## Recommended SDK Version (JDK 21)

I recommend using Java SDK version 14 or any version higher than 14 for the assignments in this course. Ensure that your development environment is configured with the appropriate SDK version.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Introducing the Neuro currency
- **Class:** `NeuroConverter`
- **Description:** It’s 2023, inflation has hit us even harder than now and the European Central Bank has established a new virtual currency, called neuro. For now, neuro has only coins which correspond to 1 (whole) neuro and its denominations in cents (1 cent, 9 cents and 49 cents). Obviously, whoever thought of these denominations had a funny sense of math! You are asked to develop a program that changes a given amount of neuro money into smaller monetary units. The program lets the user enter an amount as a double value representing a total in neuros (e.g. 11.56), and outputs a listing of the monetary equivalent in the number of coins (choosing among neuro-coins, 49-cent coins, 9-cent coins, and 1-cent coins) so as to result in the minimum number of small coins..

### Assignment 2: Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
- **Package:** `RPSLO`
- **Description:** Here you are asked to develop a version where the user plays against the computer!. Your program should ask the user to enter a play, and generate a random play for the computer, compare the two and announce the winner (optionally providing the reason!). The rules are simple (as mentioned in the video in the link above):
    - Scissors cut Paper
    - Paper covers Rock
    - Rock crushes Lizard
    - Lizard poisons Spock
    - Spock smashes Scissors
    - Scissors decapitate Lizard
    - Lizard eats Paper
    - Paper disproves Spock
    - Spock vaporizes Rock
    - Rock crushes Scissors
  

### Assignment 2: Cool Numbers
- **Class:** `CoolNumbers`
- **Description:** This week you’ll write an algorithmic approach to what we call “cool” numbers. Given a (non-zero) positive integer n, a number is considered “cool” if n is divisible by each of the number’s digits without remainder.
